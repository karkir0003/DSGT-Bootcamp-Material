Special thanks to Kaggle and the poster for providing the datasets for this drill. 

Imagine that you are the CEO of your own airline. You as the CEO want to grow your airline company to be as big as Delta, Southwest, American, etc and reach a wider customer base. To do that, you have conducted a survey to understand customer satisfaction of your services. The provided csv files contain the results of this survey. You want to figure out what factors contribute to passenger satisfaction and most importantly if you can predict if a passenger is satisfied with your services. Armed with your knowledge about ML, let's tackle this and figure out how to grow your business. 

This link provides some information about your data. Attached is the train.csv file in which you will use to build your algorithm off of. Our goal is to get an accuracy of at least 85%. 

Your code must live in exercise.py file and we have provided you with some starting points. You are free to add any helper functions and imports you would like, but the train_model() function must be implemented in order for you to run the submission properly. Please do not copy/plagiarize a solution you see from other Internet sources. Your work must be your own! Cite any sources that helped you complete this assignment
