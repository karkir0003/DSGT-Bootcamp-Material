    An iterative way to find the coefficients a,b for y = a + bx linear regression model

    Gradient descent for linear regression uses the Mean Squared Error (MSE) function to update the values for a, b coefficients

    Your job is to implement gradient descent for linear regression. Return format should be in a numpy array
