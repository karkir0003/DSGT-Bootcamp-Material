Special thanks to Andrew Ng's Machine Learning Course on Coursera for the dataset

In `exercise.py` , we are going to implement some regression models from scratch. You are only allowed to use `numpy` to build the regression models. You can only add imports to handle reading in of the data (eg: `json`, `StringIO`, etc).  Do not add extra imports beyond that (so no `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, `scipy`, etc which could trivialize the assignment/exercise)  

Background: Imagine that you are the CEO of a restaurant chain. You are trying to figure what locations to expand your business. Based on the existing franchise locations, you have knowledge of the population of the area and the profit generated. The first column of your data refers to the population size in 10,000s and the second column of your data refers to the profit in $10,000s. Let's use that data to solve our problem!
